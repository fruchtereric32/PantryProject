# PantryProject

This project will allow for users to enter what items they keep in their pantry and any dietary restrictions.
They can then get recipes brought down for them as options for food using decided upon filters like calorie count and others.
They can also choose how many of the ingredients they already have to own.
The will have to choose which main of theirs they want to use though.
